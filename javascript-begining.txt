javascript

	-> programming language
	-> originally designed to run in browser using javascript engine
	-> By using node we can run the code outside
	-> Browser and node provide run time environment for the javascript

	ECMA script -> It is just a specification developed in 1997.
		    -> Es6 - 2015

	-> For best practise script should be the end of the body instead of head tag
		-> else while running the code engine will be busy with running(parsing) the js instead of rendering, it will produce bad user experience.
		-> second reason is the js will do with html element, 

	-> By default the value of the variable is undefined.

   Primitive Types

	variable declaration

		-> cannot start with number. eg. 1name
		-> cannot contain space or - in between
		-> case sensitive
		-> Use camel notation

		-> All types are number (int or float)
		-> undefined is value as well as type	

   Reference Types

	Object
		-> Dot notation => simplest way
		-> Bracket notation => used for dynamic keys
			eg. let key = 'something'
			    objectName[key]

	Array
		-> Array is a datastructure used to represent list of items
		-> array is dynamic in js (we can store any datatype e.g. let value = ['sam', 1])

	Function
		
		// performing a task
		function great(name) {  -------------> here is parameter
			console.log('hello ' + name);
		}
		great('john'); -----> here is argument

		// calculating a value
		function square(num) {
			return num * num;
		}
		console.log(square(2));
Node 

	-> node is a program that includes google v8 js engine.
	
	To run js in node
		-> Install node from nodejs.org
		-> Move to the folder
		-> Run node fileName.js



Two types of programming language

	-> static language	eg. String name = "abc"; -----> Type cannot be changed after
	-> Dynamic language	eg. let name = 'abc'; ------> Type can be changed after
